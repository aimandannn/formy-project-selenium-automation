Project Title:  Formy Automation Project

This project contains automated test cases for the Formy web application. It uses Selenium WebDriver with Java to automate interactions with various web elements like forms, dropdowns, and file uploads. The tests are built with JUnit and managed by Maven.

Prerequisites

i.     Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.

ii.    Maven: Version 3.6 or higher.

iii.   Git: For cloning the repository.

iv.    Web Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

v.     WebDriver: The appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser (e.g., chromedriver.exe). You can include a note on how Selenium Manager now handles this automatically in newer versions.
